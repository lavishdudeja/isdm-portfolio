                            <p>Two major challenges and limitations that project management encounters in complex situations: exploration, stakeholder involvement.
<br><b>Design thinking</b> as following perspectives: a cognitive one referring to the creative and explorative activity of design, an organizational one referring to the stakeholders involved in the design process.
Based on its strong and wide user-centered orientation, design thinking can help address stakeholder management within the exploration project phase.
 
<br>
<br>Project itself can be considered as system and most of parts of project are similar to system.<b> System Thinking</b> at the beginning of the implementation phase lays out the workflow for the project. There are two main advantages in doing this. First, the resource requirements for the project can be identified; and, second, the effects of feedback systems, such as those created by lags and delays rework, can be modelled.

                                <p>Evaluators understand how different components work together under various circumstances to influence movement. This enables evaluators to better identify where to look, what to measure, when to measure, how to recommend action, and why the proposed approach is important for decision makers to consider.<br><br>
A systems approach may be used to support evaluation, consider multiple uses of mapping the relationships among the many variables and factors of a complex system, including identification of leverage points, anticipation of unintended consequences and unexpected results, and comprehensive assessment of stakeholder views.<br><br>
Values plays an important role in evaluation such as how data is collected and presented. How we are interacting with user while taking information.

1. Becoming User Centred <br>
When implementing evaluations, this translates into gaining a solid understanding of whom the evaluation end beneficiaries are, and then involving them as much as possible in the evaluation design, data collection, and analysis. <br>
2. Identifying Latent Needs <br>
The identification of latent needs has implications for the foundation of any evaluation.<br>
3. Implementing Rapid Prototyping <br>
Translating into a flexible evaluation design, and short feedback loops around data and findings.Â Developmental Evaluation, an approach that has recently come to the fore around evaluating social innovations, thrives on rapid feedback loops and flexible, iterative evaluation design

                            <p>Program Theory covers some aspects of System Thinking and Design Thinking. Such as Situational Analysis approach uses concept of delving deep in problem, finding the root cause and what are the consequences of it. 
Outcomes Chain uses concept of cause and effect relationship of system thinking, where we can understand what things will happen first and what cause other.<br><br>
System Thinker while creating situational analysis and outcomes chain can uses next level of system thinking, finding the cause and effect relationship in situational analysis and understanding the factors effecting them. While doing analysis System Thinker can see the sectoral connection and  see the system as whole and than respond to the situation.
<br><br>Design Thinking approach could be applied directly while working on theory of change, focusing on stakeholders, and building theory around them.<br><br>
In Program Theory Matrix, both system thinking and design thinking could be applied, for example system thinking could be applied in identifying the program and non program factor while design thinking will be useful while defining activities and how we are going to do activities.<br><br>
Values factor drives whole program theory, how we choosing our approach to move forward.

Design thinking used to develop best tactic for situations to achieve Change Step objectives. Design Thinking  used to understand the need of customers and innovate around them, this thinking can be implemented from C-Suite and trickle down to bottom of pyramid, but beauty of this is that from where ever it comes from it will focus on the customer/stakeholders

An important factor in moving towards Systems Thinking is to define an overallÂ vision, mission and goals of the organization.Â Because Systems Thinking sees the organization as a complete system, it is essential that the strategies and plans of each part of the organization be aligned. Everyone needs to be on the same page.

<p>Marketing be around customer. Design Thinking approach helps to properly define the focus or problem and prioritizes customer needs above all. This method inspires new thinking and develops breakthrough ideas with stakeholders. While doing these, we can design and develop marketing approaches based on valuable insights.<br><br>



System Thinking approach will allow us looking at the big picture, mapping relevant actors, considering multiple perspectives identify the cause and effect relationship. Before developing strategies marketer should be aware of these things to make a mindful choice and then identifying leverage points for the development of intervention strategies
Understanding what consumers value is important because, values demonstrated powerful predictive ability. Values have also been shown to predict a variety of specific purchasing behaviors
In case of social marketing, operating from your own values is really important, and marketing should be align to organizational values

Through system thinking person will able to delve deeper and come up with the underlying assumption and emotions that are contributing to the pattern of behavior. <br><br>
Systems Thinking could be use to identify the events/patterns/structure using âicebergâ model. Iceberg framework teaches us that systemic structures â which can include feelings, beliefs, and motivations â give rise to patterns of behavior and, ultimately, the events that we observe.

Values should be included to build empathy and social skills, person has to operate from his values to connect with other person. <br><br>
Conscious Full Spectrum Response is one of the tool that amalgamate design thinking, system thinking in it along with the values person stands for.

                            <p>
In today's world, we generally focus on understanding the system, environment and other people, but forgot the importance of understanding ourselves.  In ancient times "Know thyself" (Self-knowledge) was famous in the society and considered as the highest form of knowledge. In Hamlet Shakespeare mentioned, "To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou cans’t not be false to any man."<br><br>
Interestingly in studies, it turns out that people are not aware of themselves. We don’t understand who we are, what we are doing, and why we are doing. We sometimes defensively hide ourselves and our higher potentials; and most of the times it is happening unconsciously or automatically, which makes hard for us to grow and develop skills that we need in our personal and professional lives to be successful.<br><br>
At very basic level, becoming more aware or conscious means developing the ability to be "present" or "mindful" - to build the internal "muscle" of noticing where attention goes and to be able to regularly observe ourselves from a slight distance within our own mind. It's developing the ability to catch in the act of getting lost in what are we doing.<br><br>
As we all operate, leaders also operate in one of two ways <br>
    1. they do the things in an unconscious, automatic, and habitual way; <br> 
    2. they do the things in a conscious, self-aware, more open and creative way.<br><br>
Unconscious leaders do what feels safe and what has worked earlier or that protect their self-image. When defending self-image become the top priority of the leader, all attention and energy get focused on protecting the image rather than doing the action for change. Unconscious leaders stuck in this loop of protecting self-images and become defensive.   <br><br>
Conscious leaders operate from a place of practice, mindfulness and can observe the things they think, feel, and do. Conscious leaders always in search of finding the most effective strategy to get optimal results and create positive relationships.<br><br>
The most vital element in good leadership is whether a given leader has the ability to observe and be honest about whether they are acting from a closed minded, defensive position or not. When a leader becomes more observant of their assumptions, their emotions, their motivations, and the impact of their behaviour, they can not only manage themselves more skillfully, they can also talk about points of vulnerability from a position of strength, which makes them more approachable and accessible to others.
